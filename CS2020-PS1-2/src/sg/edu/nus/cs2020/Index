transform is a function that can be used for both 
encoding and decoding images. Given a seed and a
tap, the generated sequence forms an unique password.
Using bitwise XOR, transform modifies the rgb values
of the image.
This is an useful encryption method, as the seed and tap
combination will generate the same sequence every time,
and applying bitwise XOR twice leads to the original
value. As such, if one has the seed and the tap that were
used to encrypt the picture, they can be used in
exactly the same way to decrypt as well.
